# CI/CD Project Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to continuous integration and deployment improvements for io_uring_sync4.

## Contents

- **[GITHUB_ACTIONS_IMPROVEMENTS.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS_IMPROVEMENTS.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of current GitHub Actions workflows with 16 recommendations for improvement
- **[GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md](GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md)** - Guide for setting up and understanding the GitHub Pages deployment for docs and coverage reports

## Workflow Files

The actual workflow files are located in `.github/workflows/`:

- **Current Workflows:**
  - [`ci.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) - Current CI workflow (7 jobs)
  - [`release.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/release.yml) - Current release workflow

- **Improved Workflows:**
  - [`ci-improved.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/ci-improved.yml) - Enhanced CI with concurrency control, job dependencies, and GitHub Pages deployment
  - [`release-improved.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/release-improved.yml) - Fixed release workflow with proper cross-compilation, checksums, and changelog generation

## Composite Actions

- [`setup-rust`](../../../.github/actions/setup-rust/action.yml) - Reusable action for setting up Rust with caching (eliminates code duplication)

## Quick Reference

### Key Improvements Implemented

1. ✅ Concurrency control (cancels outdated runs)
2. ✅ Reusable composite action for Rust setup
3. ✅ Job dependencies for fail-fast behavior
4. ✅ Multi-version testing (stable + beta)
5. ✅ GitHub Pages deployment for docs + coverage
6. ✅ Fixed release workflow with proper cross-compilation
7. ✅ Automated changelog generation
8. ✅ SHA256 checksums for releases
9. ✅ Artifact attestations for supply chain security
10. ✅ Dependency review for PRs

### Estimated Impact

- **40-60% faster CI runs** (concurrency control + caching)
- **High cost savings** (cancelled redundant runs)
- **High security improvements** (dependency review, attestations, permissions)

## Next Steps

1. Review the improvements in the analysis document
2. Test the improved workflows
3. Update the current workflows or create new ones
4. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
5. Monitor performance improvements
