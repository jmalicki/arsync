# PHASE 7: Full End-to-End Protocol Integration âœ… COMPLETE

**Goal**: Wire all protocol components together and validate complete flow

**Commit**: 0d8faf4

## Phase 7.1: Make Delta Functions Public âœ… COMPLETE

### Update `src/protocol/rsync.rs`

- [x] Changed visibility of core delta functions:
  - [x] `fn generate_block_checksums` â†’ `pub fn generate_block_checksums`
  - [x] `fn generate_delta` â†’ `pub fn generate_delta`
  - [x] `fn apply_delta` â†’ `pub fn apply_delta`
- [x] Verified all compile without errors
- [x] Verified all 53 library tests still pass
- [x] Added doc comments to public functions

**Why**: These functions need to be public for end-to-end integration tests to:
1. Generate checksums from basis file
2. Generate delta from new file
3. Apply delta to reconstruct file

## Phase 7.2: Add Bidirectional Multiplex Support âœ… COMPLETE

### Update `src/protocol/rsync_compat.rs`

- [x] Added `transport_mut()` to MultiplexWriter:
  ```rust
  pub fn transport_mut(&mut self) -> &mut T {
      &mut self.transport
  }
  ```
  - [x] Allows access to underlying transport
  - [x] Needed for reading after writing

- [x] Created `Multiplex<T>` struct for bidirectional communication:
  ```rust
  pub struct Multiplex<T: Transport> {
      transport: T,
      read_buffer: Vec<u8>,
      read_buffer_pos: usize,
  }
  ```
  - [x] Wraps single Transport for both read/write
  - [x] Manages internal read buffer
  - [x] Tracks buffer position

- [x] Implemented methods:
  - [x] `new(transport) -> Self`
  - [x] `read_message() -> Result<(u8, Vec<u8>)>` - read tagged message
  - [x] `write_message(tag, data) -> Result<()>` - write tagged message
  - [x] `transport_mut() -> &mut T` - access underlying transport

- [x] Fixed duplicate impl block error (consolidated methods)
- [x] Added comprehensive doc comments
- [x] Marked unused fields as #[allow(dead_code)]

## Phase 7.3: Create End-to-End Integration Test âœ… COMPLETE

### Create `tests/rsync_end_to_end_test.rs`

- [x] Created new test file (240+ lines)
- [x] Added comprehensive module-level documentation
- [x] Explained complete protocol flow being tested

#### Helper Functions

- [x] `encode_single_file(file) -> Vec<u8>`:
  - [x] Encode single FileEntry to bytes
  - [x] Append end-of-list marker
  - [x] Return complete file list message

- [x] `build_checksum_message(checksums, block_size) -> Vec<u8>`:
  - [x] Build rsync header format (4 varints)
  - [x] Append all checksums ([weak][strong])
  - [x] Return complete checksum message

- [x] `parse_checksum_message(data) -> (Vec<RsyncBlockChecksum>, u32)`:
  - [x] Parse header (4 varints)
  - [x] Extract each checksum (weak + strong)
  - [x] Return (checksums, block_size)

- [x] `receive_file_list(mplex) -> Result<Vec<FileEntry>>`:
  - [x] Read MSG_FLIST messages
  - [x] Decode file entries
  - [x] Stop at MSG_DATA(0, 0) end marker
  - [x] Return file list

#### Test: test_full_protocol_flow

- [x] Created test scenario:
  - [x] Original content: "Hello, World! Original file content."
  - [x] Modified content: "Hello, World! MODIFIED file content here!"
  - [x] FileEntry: test.txt, modified size, current mtime, mode 0o644

- [x] Created bidirectional pipes using `PipeTransport::create_pipe()`

- [x] **Sender implementation** (concurrent with receiver):
  - [x] Step 1: Handshake
    - [x] Call handshake_sender()
    - [x] Get seed from handshake
    - [x] Get capabilities
    - [x] Log handshake completion
  - [x] Step 2: Send file list
    - [x] Encode FileEntry to MSG_FLIST messages
    - [x] Send via multiplex
    - [x] Send end-of-list: MSG_DATA(0, 0)
    - [x] Log file list sent
  - [x] Step 3: Receive checksums
    - [x] Read MSG_DATA containing checksums
    - [x] Parse checksum message
    - [x] Extract block_size and checksums
    - [x] Log checksum count
  - [x] Step 4: Generate delta
    - [x] Call generate_delta(modified_content, checksums)
    - [x] Get delta instructions
    - [x] Convert to rsync tokens
    - [x] Log delta size
  - [x] Step 5: Send delta
    - [x] Send tokens as MSG_DATA
    - [x] Log completion

    - [x] Decode file entries
    - [x] Verify 1 file received
    - [x] Log file list
  - [x] Step 3: Generate checksums
    - [x] Call generate_block_checksums(original_content, block_size)
    - [x] Use seed from handshake (CRITICAL!)
    - [x] Log checksum count
  - [x] Step 4: Send checksums
    - [x] Build checksum message
    - [x] Send as MSG_DATA
  - [x] Step 5: Receive delta
    - [x] Read MSG_DATA containing tokens
    - [x] Parse tokens to delta instructions
    - [x] Log instruction count
  - [x] Step 6: Apply delta
    - [x] Call apply_delta(original_content, delta)
    - [x] Get reconstructed content
    - [x] **Verify reconstructed == modified_content**
    - [x] **BYTE-FOR-BYTE VERIFICATION** âœ…
    - [x] Log success

- [x] Run sender and receiver using `futures::join!`
- [x] Assert both complete without panic
- [x] Assert reconstruction is perfect
- [x] Log complete protocol flow success

#### Test: test_file_reconstruction_verification

- [x] Second test with different data pattern
- [x] Larger content (100+ bytes)
- [x] More complex delta (multiple chunks)
- [x] Verify byte-for-byte reconstruction
- [x] Validate seeded checksums used correctly
- [x] Confirm delta algorithm works

#### Test: test_summary

- [x] Document end-to-end test suite
- [x] List all components tested:
  - [x] Handshake protocol (seed exchange)
  - [x] File list exchange (rsync format)
  - [x] Checksum exchange (seeded)
  - [x] Delta generation
  - [x] Token stream encoding
  - [x] File reconstruction
- [x] Explain significance: proves complete rsync protocol works!
- [x] Note: This is the ultimate integration test
