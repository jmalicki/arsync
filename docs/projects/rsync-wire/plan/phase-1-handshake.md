- [x] Added to `src/protocol/mod.rs`
- [x] Protocol constants (PROTOCOL_VERSION=31, MIN=27, MAX=40)
- [x] 10 capability flags (XMIT_CHECKSUMS, XMIT_SYMLINKS, etc.)
- [x] Role enum (Sender/Receiver) with 3 helper methods

## Phase 1.2: State Machine Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

**Commit**: cb6c715

### What Was Implemented
- [x] `HandshakeState::advance()` method (304 lines)
- [x] All 9 state transitions:
  - [x] Initial → VersionSent
  - [x] VersionSent → VersionReceived
  - [x] VersionReceived → VersionNegotiated
  - [x] VersionNegotiated → FlagsSent
  - [x] FlagsSent → FlagsReceived
  - [x] FlagsReceived → CapabilitiesNegotiated
  - [x] CapabilitiesNegotiated → SeedExchange or Complete
  - [x] SeedExchange → Complete
  - [x] Complete (terminal state with error)
- [x] Error handling at each transition
- [x] Comprehensive logging (debug, info, warn)
- [x] `get_our_capabilities()` helper function

## Phase 1.3: High-Level API ✅ COMPLETE

**Commit**: 73574a5

### What Was Implemented
- [x] `handshake_sender()` - public API for sender
- [x] `handshake_receiver()` - public API for receiver
- [x] `handshake()` - general API with role parameter
- [x] All functions with doc comments and examples
- [x] Info logging at start/completion
- [x] Error extraction and propagation

  - [x] State machine basics (2 tests)
  - [x] Capability negotiation (3 tests)
  - [x] Checksum seed (3 tests)
  - [x] Version constants (1 test)
  - [x] Our capabilities (1 test)
  - [x] Role methods (3 tests)
  - [x] Summary test (1 test)
- [x] All 14/14 tests passing
