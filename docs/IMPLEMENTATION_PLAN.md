## Quality Tracking Framework

### **Level 1: High-Level Application (arsync CLI)**
- **Purpose**: Drop-in rsync replacement for simple use cases
- **Focus**: End-to-end functionality, user experience, reliability
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - [ ] Works as drop-in rsync replacement for basic copy operations
  - [ ] All possible operations use io_uring (no libc:: or std::fs:: without strong justification)
  - [ ] Handles common rsync use cases (file copy, directory copy, metadata preservation)
  - [ ] Performance meets or exceeds rsync for same-filesystem operations

### **Level 2: Library Subcrates (compio-fs-extended)**
- **Purpose**: High-quality library for eventual standalone release
  - [ ] 100% API documentation coverage with working examples
  - [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
  - [ ] Zero clippy warnings with strict CI settings
  - [ ] Production-ready error handling and edge cases
  - [ ] Type-safe APIs preventing common mistakes
  - [ ] Security-focused design (TOCTOU prevention, etc.)

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED WORK (Phase 3.1)**
- **compio-fs-extended Library**: Complete refactoring to production-ready library
  - **9/9 modules refactored**: All using io_uring operations via compio
  - **Zero libc/std::fs usage**: Everything uses io_uring or safe alternatives
  - **100% test coverage**: 46/46 unit tests passing
  - **Production quality**: Zero clippy warnings, complete documentation
  - **Security improvements**: DirectoryFd for secure operations

### üîÑ **CURRENT WORK IN PROGRESS (Phase 3.2)**
- **End-to-End Integration**: Integrating compio-fs-extended into main CLI application
- **Drop-in rsync Replacement**: Achieving basic rsync functionality with io_uring
- **io_uring-First Architecture**: Eliminating all libc:: and std::fs:: usage without strong justification
- **Simple Use Cases**: Focus on basic file/directory copy operations first

## Architecture Decisions

### Recommended Technology Stack

Based on comprehensive research and analysis, the optimal approach is:

1. **Base Library**: Use `compio` as the foundation for completion-based async I/O operations
2. **Extended Operations**: Create `compio-fs-extended` subcrate with:
   - `copy_file_range` support using direct syscalls
   - `getdents64` directory traversal
   - Complete xattr operations suite
   - `fadvise` for file access pattern optimization
   - `symlink` and `hardlink` operations
3. **Async Coordination**: Use custom async semaphore for queue depth management
4. **Per-CPU Architecture**: One compio runtime instance per CPU core
5. **Performance Optimization**: `posix_fadvise` for large file operations
6. **Modular Design**: Release extended operations as standalone crate

#### Key Technology Updates
- **Runtime**: Migrated from rio to compio for better async integration
- **Semaphore**: Custom implementation based on tokio patterns for compio compatibility
- **File Optimization**: Added fadvise support as preferred alternative to O_DIRECT
- **Architecture**: Thread-per-core with compio's completion-based I/O

### Key Design Decisions

#### Channel Blocking vs Async Compatibility
**Answer**: Channel blocking is **NOT** async-friendly and should be avoided.

**The Problem**:
- Blocking channels (`crossbeam::channel`) can monopolize async threads
- Prevents the async runtime from scheduling other tasks efficiently
- Violates Rust's cooperative scheduling model

**The Solution**:
- ‚úÖ Use `tokio::sync::mpsc` for async-friendly communication
- ‚úÖ Operations like `sender.send().await` and `receiver.recv().await` are async-compatible
- ‚úÖ Automatic backpressure through async channel semantics
- ‚ùå Avoid `crossbeam::channel` blocking operations in async contexts

#### Custom Async Semaphore Implementation
**Answer**: ‚úÖ **Highly Feasible** and recommended approach.

**Why It Works**:
- Based on proven tokio semaphore implementation patterns
- Can be adapted for compio runtime and task system
- Provides queue depth control for io_uring operations
- Essential for preventing memory exhaustion and backpressure

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Create `compio-semaphore` subcrate following tokio patterns
- Use atomic counters and waiter queues for permit management
- Integrate with compio's waker system for async coordination
- Support both owned and borrowed permit patterns

**Benefits**:
- **Queue Management**: Controls io_uring submission queue depth
- **Memory Safety**: Prevents buffer pool exhaustion
- **Performance**: Enables optimal concurrency without resource exhaustion
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with compio's async model

#### Compio Extension Strategy
**Answer**: ‚úÖ **Well-Supported** through multiple extension approaches.

**Why It Works**:
- compio has modular architecture designed for extensions
- Managed buffer system provides zero-copy operations
- Completion-based I/O enables true async operations
- Active development with regular releases (v0.16.0 current)

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: Wrapper extensions to existing `compio::fs::File`
- **Phase 2**: Subcrate development (`compio-fs-extended`)
- **Phase 3**: Custom operations via `compio-driver`
- Incremental development with backward compatibility

**Benefits**:
- **Performance**: True async I/O without thread pools
- **Extensibility**: Multiple extension strategies available
- **Modern**: Active development with latest async patterns
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing compio ecosystem

#### io_uring xattr Support
**Answer**: ‚úÖ **Fully Supported** through direct liburing bindings.

**Kernel Support**:
- io_uring supports xattr operations since kernel 5.6
- Available operations: `IORING_OP_SETXATTR`, `IORING_OP_GETXATTR`, `IORING_OP_LISTXATTR`
- liburing provides complete xattr wrappers

**Implementation Approach**:
- Direct liburing integration for xattr operations
- Safe Rust abstractions over unsafe syscalls
- Native async/await support through io_uring completion system
- No thread pool overhead - true async xattr operations

**Key Benefits**:
- **Complete Metadata Preservation**: ACLs, SELinux contexts, custom attributes
- **Optimal Performance**: No synchronous fallbacks needed
- **Consistent Architecture**: All operations use same io_uring infrastructure

## Development Workflow Requirements

### Phase Completion Checklist
After completing each phase, the following steps are **mandatory** before proceeding:

1. **Code Formatting**: Run `cargo fmt` to ensure all code is properly formatted
2. **Unit Tests**: All public functions must have corresponding unit tests
3. **System Tests**: Simple end-to-end system tests must be implemented and passing
4. **Test Execution**: All unit tests must pass (`cargo test`)
5. **Code Quality**: All clippy warnings must be resolved (`cargo clippy`)
6. **Commit**: Create a descriptive commit message following conventional commits
7. **Pull Request**: Create a PR targeting the previous branch
8. **New Branch**: Create a new branch for the next phase (stacked PR workflow)

### Stacked PR Workflow
- **Phase 1 PR**: Targets `main` branch
- **Phase 2 PR**: Targets `phase-1` branch  
- **Phase 3 PR**: Targets `phase-2` branch
- **Phase 4 PR**: Targets `phase-3` branch
- **Final PR**: Merge `phase-4` into `main` (after all phases reviewed)

This ensures incremental review and allows for easy rollback if needed.
