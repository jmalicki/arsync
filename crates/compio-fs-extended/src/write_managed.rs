//! Write operations using managed buffers for zero-copy I/O
//!
//! This module provides `write_managed` operations that accept borrowed buffers
//! from compio's `BufferPool`, enabling zero-copy writes from registered io_uring buffers.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Normal writes require copying data from borrowed buffers to owned `Vec<u8>`:
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let borrowed = file.read_managed_at(&pool, len, offset).await?;
//! dst.write_at(Vec::from(borrowed.as_ref()), offset).await?; // ← COPY!
//! ```
//!
//! With `write_managed`, we keep the buffer alive during the write:
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let borrowed = file.read_managed_at(&pool, len, offset).await?;
//! dst.write_managed_at(borrowed, offset).await?; // ← Zero-copy!
//! ```
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! The implementation holds `BorrowedBuffer` alive during the async write operation,
//! ensuring the buffer data remains valid until the io_uring operation completes.
//! Rust's borrow checker enforces this at compile time.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! For a 1GB file with 64KB chunks:
//! - **Without write_managed**: 1GB of memcpy operations (BorrowedBuffer → Vec)
//! - **With write_managed**: 0 bytes copied (direct DMA)
//! - **Expected gain**: 2-5× throughput on large files

/// Extension trait for zero-copy writes from borrowed buffers
///
/// This trait enables writing directly from `BorrowedBuffer` without copying
/// to intermediate `Vec<u8>` allocations.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use compio::runtime::BufferPool;
/// use compio_fs_extended::AsyncWriteManagedAt;
///
/// let pool = BufferPool::new(128, 65536)?;
/// let mut file = File::create("output.dat").await?;
///
/// // Get buffer from pool (e.g., from read_managed_at)
/// let buf = src.read_managed_at(&pool, 65536, 0).await?;
///
/// // Zero-copy write!
/// let written = file.write_managed_at(buf, 0).await?;
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The buffer is kept alive for the entire duration of the async operation,
/// ensuring the data pointer remains valid until the write completes.
pub trait AsyncWriteManagedAt {
    /// Write data from a borrowed buffer at a specific offset without copying
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// * `buf` - Borrowed buffer from `BufferPool` (held alive during write)
    /// * `pos` - File offset to write at
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// Number of bytes written on success.
    ///
    /// # Lifetime Management
    ///
    /// The borrowed buffer is held during the entire async operation and
    /// automatically returned to the pool after write completion.
    ///
    /// # Performance
    ///
    /// This eliminates the memory copy from `BorrowedBuffer → Vec`, providing
    /// true zero-copy I/O when combined with `read_managed_at`.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns an error if:
    /// - The write operation fails (I/O error, disk full, etc.)
    /// - The file descriptor is invalid
    /// - Permission denied
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// // Full zero-copy copy loop
    /// let pool = BufferPool::new(128, 65536)?;
    /// let mut offset = 0;
    ///
    /// loop {
    ///     // Zero-copy read
    ///     let buf = src.read_managed_at(&pool, 65536, offset).await?;
    ///     if buf.len() == 0 { break; }
    ///     
    ///     // Zero-copy write (no memcpy!)
    ///     let written = dst.write_managed_at(buf, offset).await?;
    ///     offset += written as u64;
    ///     
    ///     // buf drops here → returns to pool
    /// }
    /// ```

        // 3. Hold BorrowedBuffer until completion event
