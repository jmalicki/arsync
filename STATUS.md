# Project Status - compio-fs-extended cross-platform

Branch: investigate/compi-fs-extended-cross-platform
Date: 2025-10-17 (Updated)

## Summary

### Completed ‚úÖ
- **Linux**: Full io_uring support with all operations working
- **macOS**: Full Unix syscall support working (nix crate for *at operations)
- **Design**: Comprehensive DESIGN.md with kqueue/IOCP analysis
- **CI**: Multi-platform matrix testing (Linux + macOS)
- **Core Operations**:
  - ‚úÖ DirectoryFd with secure *at syscalls (Unix)
  - ‚úÖ fadvise: Linux io_uring, macOS returns NotSupported (posix_fadvise removed)
  - ‚úÖ fallocate: Linux io_uring, macOS F_PREALLOCATE (manual fstore_t def)
  - ‚úÖ xattr: Linux io_uring, Unix path-based
  - ‚úÖ symlink: Linux io_uring, macOS nix::unistd
  - ‚úÖ hardlink: Linux io_uring, macOS std::fs
  - ‚úÖ metadata: Linux statx, Unix nix helpers
  - ‚úÖ ownership: Unix fchown operations
  - ‚úÖ Removed copy_file_range (no io_uring support, cross-platform issues)

### Windows: Disabled (Design Rethink Needed) üîÑ

**Windows CI disabled** - All Windows code preserved but not tested.

**Why disabled:**
- DirectoryFd is fundamentally Unix-based (uses *at syscalls)
- Windows lacks Unix *at syscalls (symlinkat, fchmodat, etc.)
- Windows uses HANDLEs not file descriptors
- Current Windows stubs suggest DirectoryFd will work, but it needs different architecture

**Windows code status:**
- ‚úÖ Stubs exist for: fallocate, symlink, hardlink, xattr, ownership
- ‚úÖ All properly guarded with #[cfg(windows)]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è But DirectoryFd operations can't map to Windows *at syscalls (they don't exist)

**Future Windows work requires:**
1. **Design decision**: DirectoryFd Windows approach
   - Option A: No DirectoryFd on Windows (use path-based helpers)
   - Option B: Windows DirectoryFd with HANDLE, but path-based ops (no TOCTOU safety)
   - Option C: Separate Windows-specific safe operation pattern
2. Re-enable Windows CI after architecture decision
3. Implement chosen approach

## Next Steps
- ‚úÖ PR ready for merge with Linux + macOS support
- macOS: Optional FD-based xattr (low priority, path-based works)
- Windows: Architectural design session before implementation
