## Architecture Decisions

### Recommended Technology Stack

Based on comprehensive research and analysis, the optimal approach is:

1. **Base Library**: Use `rio` as the foundation for io_uring operations
2. **Extended Operations**: Create `io-uring-extended` subcrate with:
   - `copy_file_range` support
   - `getdents64` directory traversal
   - Complete xattr operations suite
   - Additional missing operations
3. **Async Coordination**: Use `tokio::sync::mpsc` for all inter-task communication
4. **Per-CPU Architecture**: One io_uring instance per CPU core
5. **Modular Design**: Release extended operations as standalone crate

### Key Design Decisions

#### Channel Blocking vs Async Compatibility
**Answer**: Channel blocking is **NOT** async-friendly and should be avoided.

**The Problem**:
- Blocking channels (`crossbeam::channel`) can monopolize async threads
- Prevents the async runtime from scheduling other tasks efficiently
- Violates Rust's cooperative scheduling model

**The Solution**:
- ✅ Use `tokio::sync::mpsc` for async-friendly communication
- ✅ Operations like `sender.send().await` and `receiver.recv().await` are async-compatible
- ✅ Automatic backpressure through async channel semantics
- ❌ Avoid `crossbeam::channel` blocking operations in async contexts

#### Direct liburing Bindings Feasibility
**Answer**: ✅ **Highly Feasible** and recommended approach.

**Why It Works**:
- liburing is mature and well-designed for Rust integration
- Existing examples (`rio`, `tokio-uring`) prove the concept
- liburing's API is amenable to safe Rust abstractions

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Create `io-uring-extended` subcrate that extends `rio`
- Follow rio's design patterns for safety and ergonomics
- Release as standalone crate for community use
- Incremental development - add operations as needed

**Benefits**:
- **Modularity**: Independent crate that can be reused
- **Compatibility**: Works alongside existing libraries
- **Community Value**: Fills gaps in Rust io_uring ecosystem
- **Performance**: Direct access to all io_uring capabilities

#### io_uring xattr Support
**Answer**: ✅ **Fully Supported** through direct liburing bindings.

**Kernel Support**:
- io_uring supports xattr operations since kernel 5.6
- Available operations: `IORING_OP_SETXATTR`, `IORING_OP_GETXATTR`, `IORING_OP_LISTXATTR`
- liburing provides complete xattr wrappers

**Implementation Approach**:
- Direct liburing integration for xattr operations
- Safe Rust abstractions over unsafe syscalls
- Native async/await support through io_uring completion system
- No thread pool overhead - true async xattr operations

**Key Benefits**:
- **Complete Metadata Preservation**: ACLs, SELinux contexts, custom attributes
- **Optimal Performance**: No synchronous fallbacks needed
- **Consistent Architecture**: All operations use same io_uring infrastructure

## Development Workflow Requirements

### Phase Completion Checklist
After completing each phase, the following steps are **mandatory** before proceeding:

1. **Code Formatting**: Run `cargo fmt` to ensure all code is properly formatted
2. **Unit Tests**: All public functions must have corresponding unit tests
3. **System Tests**: Simple end-to-end system tests must be implemented and passing
4. **Test Execution**: All unit tests must pass (`cargo test`)
5. **Code Quality**: All clippy warnings must be resolved (`cargo clippy`)
6. **Commit**: Create a descriptive commit message following conventional commits
7. **Pull Request**: Create a PR targeting the previous branch
8. **New Branch**: Create a new branch for the next phase (stacked PR workflow)

### Stacked PR Workflow
- **Phase 1 PR**: Targets `main` branch
- **Phase 2 PR**: Targets `phase-1` branch  
- **Phase 3 PR**: Targets `phase-2` branch
- **Phase 4 PR**: Targets `phase-3` branch
- **Final PR**: Merge `phase-4` into `main` (after all phases reviewed)

This ensures incremental review and allows for easy rollback if needed.
