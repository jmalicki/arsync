This is feature B - builds on top of feature A.

This file demonstrates the stacked PR workflow:
- feature-A adds base functionality
- feature-B (this branch) adds additional functionality on top

The critical test: Does CI run when we create a PR targeting feature-A (not main)?

UPDATE: feature-A now has the NEW CI config, so this push should trigger pull_request event!
