# compio-fs-extended: The Missing Async Filesystem Operations for Rust

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the development plan for `compio-fs-extended`, a comprehensive Rust crate that provides the missing async filesystem operations for the compio ecosystem. This project aims to become the **definitive solution** for advanced async filesystem operations in Rust, filling critical gaps in the current ecosystem.

## Project Vision

**Mission**: Create the most comprehensive, performant, and ergonomic async filesystem operations library for Rust.

**Goal**: Become the **standard library** for advanced async filesystem operations, used by thousands of Rust projects.

**Target**: Fill the gap between basic `compio::fs` operations and full kernel io_uring capabilities.

## Market Analysis

### Current State of Rust Async Filesystem Operations

#### What Exists:
- **compio::fs** - Basic file operations (open, read, write, metadata)
- **rio** - Low-level io_uring bindings, limited high-level operations
- **tokio-uring** - Tokio integration, basic file I/O
- **std::fs** - Synchronous operations only

#### Critical Gaps:
1. **No copy_file_range support** in any Rust io_uring library
2. **No xattr operations** (ACLs, SELinux contexts, custom attributes)
3. **No advanced symlink operations** (readlinkat, symlinkat)
4. **No directory operations** (getdents64, mkdirat, unlinkat)
5. **No device file operations** (mknod, mkfifo)
6. **No fadvise support** for file access pattern optimization
7. **No advanced metadata operations** (fchmod, fchown, futimens)

### Market Opportunity

#### Target Users:
- **High-performance applications** needing advanced filesystem operations
- **Backup and sync tools** requiring metadata preservation
- **Database systems** needing optimized file access patterns
- **Container runtimes** requiring advanced filesystem operations
- **File system utilities** needing comprehensive metadata handling

#### Competitive Advantage:
- **First comprehensive solution** for async filesystem operations
- **Built on compio** - the most modern async runtime
- **io_uring native** - true async operations, no thread pools
- **Complete metadata preservation** - ACLs, xattrs, timestamps
- **Performance optimized** - fadvise, copy_file_range, splice operations

## Technical Architecture

### Core Design Principles

1. **compio Native** - Built specifically for compio runtime
2. **io_uring First** - Use io_uring operations when available
3. **Graceful Fallbacks** - Fall back to syscalls when io_uring unavailable
4. **Zero-Copy Operations** - Leverage copy_file_range, splice when possible
5. **Complete Metadata** - Preserve all filesystem metadata
6. **Async/Await Native** - Full async/await support throughout
